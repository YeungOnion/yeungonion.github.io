I'm a physicist, an educator, and a programmer.
I have a [resume](/resume/)

In my free time, I like to rock climb, contribute to open source, and do yoga.
<!-- {# As of writing this, in Fall 2023, I'm searching for what amount of identity I want tied up in my career.#} -->
I'm interested in physics, and typing in computer programming.
I'd like to make a difference in reducing barriers for people to use and rely on programming skills.

I'd like to create tools that make it easier to get started, both with practical aspects and educational ones.
I started with some practical tooling, looked at projects where I could get new experience, and started a bit on a educational lesson.
